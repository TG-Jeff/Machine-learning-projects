CNN for CIFAKE: Real vs. AI-Generated Image Classification
In this project, we will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either REAL or FAKE. The dataset, CIFAKE, consists of 60,000 real images collected from the CIFAR-10 dataset and 60,000 AI-generated synthetic images created using Stable Diffusion version 1.4. The rapid advancement in AI-generated imagery has raised concerns about authenticity, making it crucial to develop tools that can distinguish between real and synthetic images.
This project aims to explore whether computer vision techniques, specifically CNNs, can effectively detect AI-generated images. The dataset is split into 100,000 training images (50,000 REAL and 50,000 FAKE) and 20,000 testing images (10,000 REAL and 10,000 FAKE).
Project Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the CIFAKE dataset. The model is trained to differentiate between real images (from CIFAR-10) and AI-generated synthetic images (from Stable Diffusion v1.4). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing these categories, addressing the growing challenge of image authenticity in the age of AI.
